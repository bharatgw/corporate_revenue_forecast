# corporate_revenue_forecast
Completed for DSA301 Time Series Analysis, in a group of 6, we model aggregated corporate revenues by their GICS industry code. Within the project, we extracted the corporate revenue data for Russell 1000 companies from COMPUSTAT and using their GICS codes, aggregated them by industry. Then we utilised various time series modelling techniques including STL decompsition, SARIMAX, VAR and VECM models to forecast future values of the time series. While creating the models, we make care to test relevant assumptions regarding stationarity, cointegration and/or autocorrelation among the data and the produced residuals. The repository contains our final report and the code I wrote to model the Healthcare sector and create a VAR model for all sectors' corporate revenues.
